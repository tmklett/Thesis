Modeling the R0 of covid within the prison population and comparing this to the general state population.
This is code that was used to support the generation of an R0 for six states both in their prison setting and general population. 
The data for the prisons was provided by the Marshall Project and Associated Press and can be found here: https://data.world/associatedpress/marshall-project-covid-cases-in-prisons.
The data for the general population was provided by the COVID Tracking Project and can be found here: https://covidtracking.com/.
The R models for the R0 analysis was provided by Ottar N. Bj√∏rnstad in his book Epidemics Models and Data using R (2018, Chapter 3)
